# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time. This is a **Zite solution** — a database plus two apps —
so contributing to it is a little different from a library, and mostly easier.

## What we're looking for

- **Bug fixes**, especially in the progress engine, reports SQL or the lesson player.
- **Lesson types, report columns, filters** — additive work that fits the existing
  shapes.
- **Accessibility and keyboard** fixes. The admin console is meant to be usable
  without a mouse; anywhere it isn't is a bug.
- **Copy and clarity.** This template is read by people who just installed it. If a
  label or empty state confused you, it will confuse them.

Please open an issue before a large change, so we can agree the shape first.

## Getting a workspace to develop against

Endpoints in `src/api/` run on Zite's runtime, not on your machine, so you need a
workspace of your own before the app will load data. Install the template into one by
following [Install it in your own workspace](README.md#install-it-in-your-own-workspace)
— it takes a few minutes and gives you the demo data to work against.

Then:

```bash
yarn install
cp .env.example .env.local   # put your workspace id in ZITE_BASE_ID
yarn dev                     # admin console on :8080
yarn dev:learner-portal      # learner portal on :8081
```

The frontend hot-reloads locally. **Endpoint changes only take effect once they're
deployed to your workspace** — edit them in a Zite sandbox and `commit`, or push and
pull them in. This catches everyone once.

## Before you open a pull request

```bash
yarn generate    # only if you added, renamed or deleted an endpoint
yarn run check   # tsc + endpoint bundling + vite build, both apps
```

`zitejs check` reports `bundle endpoints ✗` with no error on an app this size — that
is a 1 MB stdout buffer in the checker, not your change. The `tsc` and `vite build`
lines are the ones that matter. For real endpoint errors:

```bash
npx zitejs bundle --app learning-management > /tmp/b.json   # read endpointErrors
```

**A clean type-check is not proof.** SQL identifier mistakes and bad joins only
surface at runtime, because `zite.sql()` takes strings. Exercise the endpoints you
touched against a real workspace and check the logs before calling it done.

## House rules for the code

These are load-bearing — see
[Decisions worth knowing](README.md#decisions-worth-knowing-before-extending-it) for
the why.

- **Recompute, don't store.** Progress and due state come from `LessonProgress`
  through `packages/shared/server/enroll.ts`. Every write path calls it. Don't write
  `progress` or `status` directly.
- **Never trust an id for who is acting.** Admin endpoints call `getActor`, learner
  endpoints `getLearner`. The session is the only source of the actor.
- **Re-validate input on the server.** Zite does not enforce an endpoint's
  `inputSchema`.
- **No `zod` in `packages/shared`.** The root has zod 4 and endpoints use the app's
  zod 3; importing it there breaks one of them.
- **Foreign keys are text.** Cast the uuid side in joins (`c.id::text = e."courseId"`),
  and remember unset text is `''`, never `NULL` — `IS NULL` matches nothing.
- **Write in small batches.** The live database rejects write bursts. Use `eachWrite`
  and `withRetry` from `packages/shared/server/sql.ts`.
- **Match the surrounding style.** No formatter is enforced; the existing code is the
  spec. 14px working band, accent used sparingly, density over decoration.
